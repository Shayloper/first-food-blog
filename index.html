    <p><b>Ackee & Saltfish</b></p>
    <p>Ackee and codfish, or ackee and saltfish as it is more popularly known, is Jamaica’s national dish. It is made with the ackee fruit, which was imported to this region from Ghana in Africa by slaves in this territory. Now the fruit grows in abundance in Jamaica, and has become an island staple served side by side with stewed salted codfish sautéed with vegetables and other herbs and spices.~ https://www.beaches.com/</p>

    <p><b>Crack Conch w/Rice & Peas</b></p>
    <p>Conch, pronounced “konk,” is a local staple and the national dish of The Bahamas. This mollusk is found throughout regional waters and its meat is prepared in a variety of ways. You’ll find peas n’ rice as a side dish for many Bahamian meals. Another classic Bahamian side dish is baked macaroni and cheese. A true Bahamian meal would not be complete without one of these other side dishes on your plate: a creamy potato salad and cole slaw.~ https://www.nassauparadiseisland.com/</p>

    <p><b> Ropa Vieja</b></p>
    <p>Vieja, the national dish of Cuba, is a meal that is steeped in history. This rustic, humble dish so perfectly tells the story of the country’s culinary and cultural evolution over the last half-century. Like many great parts of Cuban culture, Ropa Vieja started life in Spain. Its name literally translates to ‘old clothes’ and the story goes that a penniless old man once shredded and cooked his own clothes because he could not afford food for his family.~ www.revoluciondecuba.com</p>
